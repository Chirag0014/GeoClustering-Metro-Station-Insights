**GeoClustering**: Metro Station Insights is a Python project for clustering metro station data using a manually implemented **K-Means algorithm**. It focuses on analyzing geographic data, evaluating cluster quality, and visualizing insights.

**Features**
**Manual K-Means:** Custom implementation for clustering without libraries.
**Silhouette Analysis:** Manually computes and visualizes silhouette scores.
**Data Insights**: Summarizes cluster statistics for metro stations.
**Visualization**: Displays clusters and silhouette scores in clear, intuitive plots.

**Usage**
Preprocess data with outlier removal and feature scaling.
Perform manual K-Means clustering on station data.
Analyze results using silhouette scores and cluster summaries.
Visualize clusters and evaluate their quality.

**Files**
**GeoClustering.py:** Main script for clustering and visualization.
**stations.csv:** Sample metro station dataset.
